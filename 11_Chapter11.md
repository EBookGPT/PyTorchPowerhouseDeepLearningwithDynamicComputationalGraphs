# Chapter 11: Using Pre-trained Models in PyTorch - Unleashing the Power of Transfer Learning

Welcome, dear readers, to another exciting chapter of PyTorch Powerhouse: Deep Learning with Dynamic Computational Graphs, where we explore the infinite possibilities of the PyTorch library.

In our previous chapter, we learned about transfer learning, a technique that allows us to reuse pre-trained models to solve new problems. We dove deep into the intricacies of transfer learning and learned how to fine-tune pre-trained models to achieve state-of-the-art results.

In this chapter, we will take transfer learning to the next level and learn how to use pre-trained models directly, without fine-tuning. These pre-trained models have been trained on massive datasets and have learned to extract a wide range of features that can be used for a variety of tasks.

To guide us through this journey, we have a special guest, Sergey Levine, a renowned researcher in the field of deep learning and robotics. Sergey has made significant contributions to the area of transfer learning and has published several papers to this effect. We will learn from his insights and experiences in using pre-trained models to solve real-world problems.

We will start by discussing what pre-trained models are, why they are useful, and how to use them in PyTorch. We will explore some of the popular pre-trained models in PyTorch and learn how to use them for classification, object detection, and other tasks.

As always, we will supplement our learning with code examples that demonstrate how to use pre-trained models in PyTorch. We will also discuss some best practices when using pre-trained models and some limitations to be aware of.

So, buckle up, dear readers, as we embark on another exhilarating chapter of PyTorch Powerhouse: Deep Learning with Dynamic Computational Graphs, and learn how to unleash the power of transfer learning using pre-trained models!
# Chapter 11: Using Pre-trained Models in PyTorch - Unleashing the Power of Transfer Learning

The sun had set, and the darkness had crept in. Dracula sat at his desk, staring at his computer screen. He had a tough problem to solve, and he needed to find a solution quickly.

Dracula was a master at solving complex problems, but this one was particularly vexing. He was trying to build a machine that could recognize different types of monsters based on their pictures. He had tried everything, but nothing seemed to work.

Just then, there was a knock on the door. Dracula rose from his chair and opened the door. To his surprise, he saw a man standing there, dressed in a suit.

"Good evening, Dracula," the man said. "My name is Sergey Levine, and I am a researcher in the field of deep learning and robotics."

Dracula was intrigued. He had heard of Sergey Levine and his work on transfer learning. "Please come in," he said.

Sergey entered the room and sat down. "I understand that you are having trouble building a machine that can recognize different types of monsters," he said.

Dracula nodded. "Yes, I have tried everything, but nothing seems to work."

"Have you tried using pre-trained models?" Sergey asked.

Dracula shook his head. "I have not heard of them before," he said.

Sergey smiled. "Pre-trained models are models that have been trained on massive datasets and have learned to extract a wide range of features that can be used for a variety of tasks," he said. "Using pre-trained models can save you a lot of time and effort."

Dracula was intrigued. "How do I use pre-trained models in PyTorch?" he asked.

Sergey explained that PyTorch has several pre-trained models available, such as VGG, ResNet, and Inception. He showed Dracula some code examples and explained how to use pre-trained models for classification, object detection, and other tasks.

Dracula was amazed. Using pre-trained models was easier than he thought. He thanked Sergey and promised to use pre-trained models in his future projects.

As Sergey left the room, Dracula felt relieved. He had found a solution to his problem, and it was all thanks to pre-trained models in PyTorch.

The darkness had lifted, and Dracula was ready to take on the world of deep learning once again, armed with the power of transfer learning using pre-trained models.
To assist Dracula in his quest to build a machine that could recognize different types of monsters, our special guest, Sergey Levine, introduced him to the concept of pre-trained models in PyTorch. In this section, we will explain the code used to implement pre-trained models for solving Dracula's problem.

We will start by discussing the steps involved in using pre-trained models in PyTorch.

### Steps to Use Pre-trained Models in PyTorch
1. Load the pre-trained model
2. Freeze the weights of the pre-trained model
3. Replace the output layer with a new layer that suits your task
4. Train the new layer only
5. Fine-tune the pre-trained layer if necessary

Let's see how to use pre-trained models for classification tasks.

### Using Pre-trained Models for Classification
To use a pre-trained model for classification tasks, we need to replace the output layer with a new layer that matches the number of classes in our dataset.

``` python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

# load the pre-trained model
model = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)

# freeze the weights of the pre-trained model
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# replace the output layer with a new layer
num_classes = 10
n_inputs = model.classifier[6].in_features
last_layer = nn.Linear(n_inputs, num_classes)
model.classifier[6] = last_layer
```

In the above code, we load the VGG16 pre-trained model and freeze its weights by setting `requires_grad` to `False`. We then replace the output layer with a new layer that has `num_classes` output nodes. We get the input features of the last layer using `model.classifier[6].in_features` and replace it with a new layer using `nn.Linear(n_inputs, num_classes)`. Lastly, we replace the last layer of the classifier using `model.classifier[6] = last_layer`.

We can use the same approach for other pre-trained models such as ResNet and Inception.

### Conclusion
Pre-trained models are a powerful tool that can save us a lot of time and effort in deep learning. With just a few lines of code, we can use pre-trained models for a variety of tasks such as classification, object detection, and more. By following the steps outlined in this section, we can easily use pre-trained models in PyTorch and solve complex problems like Dracula's.
