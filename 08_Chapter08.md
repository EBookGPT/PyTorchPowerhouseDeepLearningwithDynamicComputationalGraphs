#CHAPTER 8: RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS IN PYTORCH

Welcome back to PyTorch Powerhouse: Deep Learning with Dynamic Computational Graphs. After diving deep into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the last chapter, we are now ready to explore Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their applications in PyTorch.

But first, let's introduce our special guest for this chapter - Andrej Karpathy, Director of AI at Tesla and renowned computer scientist. Karpathy is a prominent figure in the deep learning community and has made significant contributions to the field of RNNs, particularly with his work on sequence-to-sequence models and character-level language models.

In this chapter, we'll dive into the architecture and inner workings of RNNs, which are particularly useful for data sets with temporal dependencies. We will explore how PyTorch's dynamic computational graph makes it easier to handle sequences of varying lengths, as compared to traditional static graph frameworks.

We'll also cover different types of RNN architectures such as Simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU, and their respective use cases. Our goal is not just to understand the different RNN architectures but also to learn how to implement them in PyTorch.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a strong understanding of sequential data processing with RNNs in PyTorch, along with practical applications, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and time series prediction.

So, let's dive in and learn from the best in the field. With Karpathy as our guide, we are sure to be in good hands on this thrilling journey through the world of Recurrent Neural Networks.
# CHAPTER 8: RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS IN PYTORCH

The castle walls shook as Dracula rose from his slumber. His deep growls echoed throughout the halls as he roamed the castle, searching for prey. His eyes glowed as he entered his laboratory, where he had been working on his latest experiment.

But Dracula's latest attempt at creating a monster seemed to have failed yet again. His creation was supposed to learn how to speak, but it could not seem to form coherent sentences, let alone understand Dracula's commands.

Discouraged, Dracula knew he needed a new approach. He needed a way to create a monster that could understand his commands and learn from its mistakes, much like a human would.

Suddenly, a knock at his door interrupted his thoughts. It was Andrej Karpathy, the renowned deep learning expert.

"I've heard from the villagers that you have been struggling with your latest creation," said Karpathy. "I may have a solution for you."

Dracula was shocked that such a renowned scientist would visit his humble castle. But he welcomed Karpathy inside and listened intently as the scientist shared his knowledge of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

Karpathy explained how RNNs could be used to process sequential data such as speech and text, allowing a monster to understand and learn from context. He also noted the advantages of using PyTorch's dynamic computational graph for handling varying sequence lengths.

Excited about the possibilities, Dracula immediately set to work on implementing RNNs in his latest creation using PyTorch, with Karpathy guiding him along the way.

With PyTorch's ease of use and powerful capabilities, Dracula was able to train his monster to understand and respond to his commands, even in complex and ever-changing contexts.

As they watched Dracula's creation come to life, Karpathy shared his own experiences using RNNs in cutting-edge applications in industries ranging from autonomous vehicles to natural language processing.

Together, Dracula and Karpathy had embarked on a thrilling journey through the world of Recurrent Neural Networks, discovering new possibilities for creating monsters that could learn and adapt to any situation.

And thus, Dracula's laboratory had become a hub of innovation in deep learning, with PyTorch Powerhouse leading the way.
# Explanation of Code used in Dracula Story

In the story, Dracula uses PyTorch to implement Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to train his monster to understand and respond to his commands, even in complex and ever-changing contexts. The PyTorch framework enables Dracula to create dynamic computational graphs that can handle varying sequence lengths in its input data.

To better understand how PyTorch is used in the story, let's take a deeper look at the code used for training the RNN.

First, we import the necessary PyTorch libraries:

```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
```

Next, we define the RNN architecture as a subclass of `nn.Module`, with a specified number of hidden layers and output classes:

```
class RNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(RNN, self).__init__()

        self.hidden_size = hidden_size

        self.i2h = nn.Linear(input_size + hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.i2o = nn.Linear(input_size + hidden_size, output_size)
        self.softmax = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1)

    def forward(self, input, hidden):
        combined = torch.cat((input, hidden), 1)

        hidden = self.i2h(combined)
        output = self.i2o(combined)
        output = self.softmax(output)

        return output, hidden
```

Here, `input_size` corresponds to the size of the input data, `hidden_size` is the size of the hidden layer, and `output_size` is the number of output classes.

The `forward` function maps the input data to its corresponding output using a combination of linear layers and a softmax function applied to the output. The `hidden` vector is updated at each time step using the `i2h` linear layer.

We then define the training process, including the loss function and optimizer:

```
criterion = nn.NLLLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(rnn.parameters(), lr=0.1)

def train(input_tensor, target_tensor):
    hidden = rnn.initHidden()

    rnn.zero_grad()

    for i in range(input_tensor.size()[0]):
        output, hidden = rnn(input_tensor[i], hidden)

    loss = criterion(output, target_tensor)
    loss.backward()

    optimizer.step()

    return output, loss.item()
```

Here, `criterion` is the negative log likelihood loss function, and `optimizer` is the stochastic gradient descent optimizer.

The `train` function initializes the hidden layer, feeds the input data through the RNN architecture, computes the loss using the negative log likelihood loss function, and backpropagates the loss to update the weights using the optimizer.

With this code, we see how PyTorch's powerful RNN architecture and dynamic computational graph make it possible for Dracula to train his monster to understand and adapt to his commands, thanks to the guidance of Andrej Karpathy.
