# Chapter 7: Convolutional Neural Networks in PyTorch

The world of deep learning is a vast one, full of intricacies and complexities that can often leave even the most seasoned practitioners bewildered. In our journey towards understanding this world of PyTorch Powerhouse, we have come across many chapters that have helped us understand the building blocks of deep learning.

In the previous chapter on optimization, we learned how to fine-tune our models to achieve the highest accuracy with the most efficient use of our resources. But there's still so much to learn in the field of deep learning.

In this chapter, we will explore Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specific class of neural networks that are particularly good at computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

CNNs have revolutionized the world of image processing and analysis. They work by using convolutional layers to extract meaningful features from images and then passing them through various layers to classify the input image. They are widely used in a variety of applications in image and video processing, natural language processing, and even games.

Our special guest for this chapter is none other than Yann LeCun, one of the pioneers of CNNs and the winner of the 2018 Turing Award. His contributions to the field of computer vision have paved the way for many breakthroughs in the deep learning community.

Together with Yann, we will explore some of the key concepts and best practices for building CNNs in PyTorch. We will discuss how to build and train CNNs, how to choose the right architecture for your task, and how to optimize your model for performance.

So, buckle up and get ready to dive deep into the world of CNNs with PyTorch Powerhouse!

## The Tale of the Vampire Image Classifier

As the sun began to set over the city, the residents slowly retreated into their homes, locking their doors and windows. They knew better than to venture out at night, for they were all too familiar with the dangers that lurked in the shadows.

But there was one creature, one entity that roamed the streets with unparalleled confidence. The vampire, with his razor-sharp fangs and supernatural strength, was a force to be reckoned with. He moved swiftly through the city, his eyes scanning the darkened alleys for his next victim.

The vampire had a new plan. He dreamed of creating an army of his own kind by turning humans into vampires with a special elixir. However, he needed help with his plan. He needed an image classifier to help him identify humans who had a higher probability of surviving the transformation through the elixir.

Luckily for him, he had heard of Yann LeCun, the mastermind behind the development of Convolutional Neural Networks. Yann was renowned for his expertise in the field of computer vision and had developed some of the most powerful image classifiers in the world.

The vampire, disguised as a wealthy businessman, arranged for a meeting with Yann LeCun, hoping to employ him to build a powerful image classifier that would help him achieve his dark goal.

Yann was initially hesitant to take on the project but was eventually persuaded by the vampire's offer of unlimited resources and access to the most advanced computing systems.

After months of research, development, and testing, Yann had created an image classifier that was more advanced and powerful than anything seen before. It used a complex convolutional neural network architecture that could extract the smallest of features and identify even the most subtle of patterns.

The vampire was delighted with the classifier and began to use it to identify suitable victims for his experiment. But little did he know that Yann had hidden a secret in the network's architecture.

Yann had included a backdoor in the neural network that could identify and flag any images related to the vampire's plan. While the classifier worked perfectly for all other tasks, it would always identify images related to vampires and flag them for further analysis.

In the end, the vampire's plan failed, and Yann's clever trickery saved the city from being overrun by an army of the undead.

## Exploring CNNs in PyTorch with Yann LeCun

This tale is, of course, fictional, but the concepts behind it are based on real-world applications of Convolutional Neural Networks. Together with Yann LeCun, we will explore how to build and train neural networks with PyTorch, how to choose the right architecture for your task, and how to optimize your model for performance.

Let's dive into the world of CNNs with PyTorch Powerhouse and learn how to build powerful image classifiers like Yann's, minus the backdoor!
## The PyTorch Code Behind the Image Classifier

Now, let's take a look at the code that powers Yann's image classifier.

To begin, we will start by importing the necessary PyTorch modules and setting the device type to use for running the code.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
```

Next, we will define our CNN architecture using PyTorch's nn.Module class. In this case, we will use a 3-layer CNN with ReLU activation and max-pooling layers.

```python
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

net = Net()
net.to(device)
```

We will also define our loss function and optimizer.

```python
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)
```
Next, we will use PyTorch's DataLoader class to load and preprocess our image data.

```python
trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=4,
                                          shuffle=True, num_workers=2)
testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=4,
                                         shuffle=False, num_workers=2)
```

Finally, we will train our CNN on the data and optimize the model.

```python
for epoch in range(2):  
    running_loss = 0.0
    for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        outputs = net(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        running_loss += loss.item()

        if i % 2000 == 1999:    
            print('[%d, %5d] loss: %.3f' % (epoch + 1, i + 1, running_loss / 2000))
            running_loss = 0.0
```
And that's it! With this code, we can train powerful image classifiers like Yann LeCun's. Through our exploration with PyTorch Powerhouse, we can push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of deep learning.
